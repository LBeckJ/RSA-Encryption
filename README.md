# RSA-Encryption
Encrypt and Decrypt messages with the RSA algorithm (PÃ¥ dansk)
---
# Usage
*
At the top of the code choose the variables p and q. These variables are two prime-number (The larger the number, the safer the encryption)

Then you can set the message to anything you want.
By using the function "enkyptering(str, e, N)" you encrypt messages.
Then with the function "dekryptering(list of ints, d, N)" it will return the decrypted message. :D
